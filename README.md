# Neurocat Beamer Template

The template is defined in the `*.sty` files. An example of how to use it is implemented in `example_presentation.tex`

Compilation only works with xelatex or lualatex. The deprecated pdflatex is no longer supported due to problem with different fonts.

## TODO
- set fonts correctly
- put the text at the top by default for normal slides. Problem there is the distinction between titlepage and normal page and the offset of the frametitle. Otherwise the frame option [t] could be used.
